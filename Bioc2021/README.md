## Title

The R for Mass Spectrometry Initiative

## Abstract

The objectives of the ​*R for Mass Spectrometry* initiative
(https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/) are to provide a data analysis
and development environment for mass spectrometry assays such as
proteomics and metabolomics. In particular, we want this environment
to be **flexible​** (it must fit several use cases, including
user-centered applications such as advanced data analysis and
exploration, and developer-centered requirements such as novel method
and pipeline development), **efficient** (the environment must be able
to transparently deal with small and large, local or remote data using
one consistent interface), **scalable** (applicable on desktops and
laptops as well as remote data and compute servers, including cloud
infrastructure), **reproducible** (to support reproducible research
practices) as well as thoroughly **tested** and **documented**.
