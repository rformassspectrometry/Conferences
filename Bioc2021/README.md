## Title

The R for Mass Spectrometry Initiative

## Abstract

The aim of the [R for Mass Spectrometry
initiative](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/) is to provide
efficient, thoroughly documented, tested, flexible and interoperable R
software for the analysis and interpretation of high throughput mass
spectrometry assays, including proteomics and metabolomics
experiments. The project formalises the longtime collaborative efforts
of the core members under the R for Mass Spectrometry organisation to
facilitate dissemination and accessibility of their work and gather
contributions from the wider community.
